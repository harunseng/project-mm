# project-mm
This project includes several third-party libraries and assets that enhance development efficiency, UI/UX, and game functionality. Below is a list of used libraries and assets along with brief descriptions.

## Third-Party Libraries

### [VContainer](https://github.com/hadashiA/VContainer)
A lightweight dependency injection framework for Unity. It helps manage object lifetimes and dependencies cleanly, enabling modular and testable code.

### [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask)
An alternative to C#'s built-in `async/await` system, specifically optimized for Unity. It reduces memory allocation and improves performance on the main thread.

### [DoTween](https://github.com/Demigiant/dotween)
A powerful and efficient tweening engine for Unity. It allows you to create smooth animations and transitions for UI, game objects, and more with minimal effort.

### [Safe Area Helper](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/safe-area-helper-130488)

## Level Editor

A custom Level Editor is included in the project to facilitate the creation and management of game levels.

- You can create and edit levels using an in-editor UI tool.
- Each level should follow the naming convention: `LevelData_<level number>`.
- Level numbers should be consecutive.
- There are already 3 levels present in the project (`LevelData_1`, `LevelData_2`, and `LevelData_3`), so the next new level should be named: `LevelData_4`.
